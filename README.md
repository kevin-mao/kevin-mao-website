# Work out for free using Cloud Fitness
Check it out [here](http://www.cloudfitness.io/)

I deployed Cloud Fitness to help users try out gyms in their area by finding free gym guest passes for them. The app makes the tedious process much easier by using web scraping and using APIs and storing gym data in a database for fast lookup.

Built with Python Flask, Google Maps and Javascript API, Heroku, SQLite, MongoDB
